Raspberry Pi Sushi cards

To add a sushi card use the [Sushi template.dotx] (https://github.com/CoderDojoDunLaoghaire/PiSushi/blob/c8aa71a78d7f3342a26250c6d98eca3b2402259e/Sushi%20template.dotx) provided by Francis Reed. Double click on this file to open a new word document with the right format.

When you first open the document, go into the Document Properties and change the `Title` and `Subject` (you may need to click `Show All Properties` to see `Subject`), this will automatically update the header. As you create new pages the header will automatically update including the page number.

Use the styles to make it easier to produce a consistent format:
 - Sushi Normal - normal text
 - Sushi Section Number - in the text that bolded number for a section of text
 - Sushi Section Highlight - to highlight a portion of text
 - Sushi Command - used to represent text to run at the command line 
 - Sushi Code - used to show code
